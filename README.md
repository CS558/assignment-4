assignment-4
============
For this assignment, you should implement a module that solves a problem related to either polygons or range searching; or implements some sort of sweep line method.

# Projects

### [`region-quadtree-2d`](https://github.com/melanz/region-quadtree-2d)

Author: Daniel Melanz

The region quadtree represents a partition of space in two dimensions by decomposing the region into four equal quadrants, subquadrants, and so on with each leaf node containing data corresponding to a specific subregion.

### [`point-polygon-distance`] (https://github.com/hanasarbortova/point-polygon-distance)

Author: Hana Sarbortova

Compute distance of a point from an arbitrary shaped polygon (either perpendicular
distance from a line segment (if projection exists) or distance from the nearest vertex)

### Box Overlaps

Author: Michael Doescher

Report all box overlaps using a sweep-line algorithm.

### [`Line Intersection`] (https://github.com/ychu8/sweep-line-intersection)

Author: Yung-Hsien Chu

Find line intersections using sweep line test, return points of the intersections.

### Point in Polygon

Author: Richard Gaggioli



# Ideas

* Robust point in polygon tests using exact arithmetic
* Sweep line test to find crossings between line segments
* Other sweep-line algorithms; ie report all box overlaps.
* Fast point in polygon tests for special kinds of shapes (convex, star shaped, monotone, etc.)
* Optimized kdtrees or range trees for arbitrary dimensions
